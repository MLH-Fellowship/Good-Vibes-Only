    <blockquote>Albert Schweitzer, a German physician and Nobel Peace Prize winner, had it right when he said, “Happiness is the only thing that multiplies when you share it.”</blockquote> 
  <p align="center">
  As it turns out, plenty of research backs up this idea that sharing good news contributes to greater well-being for all.
   Sharing good news with others not only makes you feel better, but also improves the well-being of those around you.
    Many people have a tendency to attach greater weight to negative experiences. Focusing on grateful experiences both by writing them down and sharing them with others helps counteract this tendency by drawing attention to the good things in life.
    <br><br>
  Every day good things happen that go unnoticed. Even small victories like getting a good night’s rest, drinking the perfect cup of coffee, enjoying a sunset on a warm summer’s day, all those little things can become positive experiences to share with others. In doing so, we not only lift our own spirits, but give those around us a chance to experience that joy with us. In this way, we all can also actively become the anecdote to bad news through sharing positive experiences with others.
